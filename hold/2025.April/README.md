TL;DR is that as I'm trying to more fully engage with AI tools to help me learn, I'm not trusting that the "answers" i get will remain available forever on the sites of those respective AI tools (though I guess I could simply save all the prompt questions and assume answers in the future would only get better?), and I'm getting hung up on the formatting munging (with mathematical content that seems to be LaTeX based underneath somehow and then not getting perfectly "web rendered" via markdown files (i did try pasting into google drive docs as well, but that seemed like a box canyon that led away from a solution vs. towards it (I'm pretty sure the true answer is for me to learn more LaTeX actually, but that's not a priority for me now)).


find the "original" content from each of the three tools (which i've tried to copy and paste markdown from into each of the subdirectories here) at these URIs:

claude shines in terms of "accuracy" though the mathematical formulae rendering isn't as good as grok's (in my humble opinion), which maybe is why it's more portable? chatgpt seems to be the worst at this, though i didn't get around to asking it to solve the problem for me like i did with grok (grok's extensive answers probably hold the key, but I think I'm better served by actually spending my time studying the content rather than chasing this particular (formatting?) squirrel round and round a bunch of trees...)
