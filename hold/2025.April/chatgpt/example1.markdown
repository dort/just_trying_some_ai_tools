In the context of kernel functions and the phrase **"not strictly positive definite"**, here's what it means:

---

### **Positive Definite Kernel**
A kernel function \( K(x, x') \) is **positive definite** if, for any finite set of points \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \), the kernel matrix \( K \), where \( K_{ij} = K(x_i, x_j) \), is:

- **Symmetric**: \( K_{ij} = K_{ji} \)
- **Positive semi-definite**: For any non-zero vector \( \mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{R}^n \),
  \[
  \mathbf{c}^T K \mathbf{c} \geq 0
  \]

If **strictly positive definite**, then:
  \[
  \mathbf{c}^T K \mathbf{c} > 0 \quad \text{for all non-zero } \mathbf{c}
  \]

This property ensures that the kernel corresponds to a valid inner product in some (possibly infinite-dimensional) feature space, which is essential for many algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

---

### **Sigmoid Kernel and the Issue**
The **sigmoid kernel** is defined as:
\[
K(x, x') = \tanh(\alpha x^T x' + c)
\]

The problem is:
- For certain choices of \( \alpha \) and \( c \), this kernel **does not** produce a positive definite matrix.
- That means it **might not correspond to a valid inner product** in a Hilbert space.
- As a result, it doesn't always satisfy the Mercer condition (a key requirement for kernels used in SVMs).

---

### **Why This Matters**
- If a kernel is not positive definite, algorithms like SVMs can behave unpredictably or fail to converge.
- Unlike kernels like the RBF or polynomial kernel, which are always positive definite, the sigmoid kernel needs careful parameter tuning to remain usable.

Would you like an example showing how the sigmoid kernel matrix can fail to be positive definite for some data and parameters?
