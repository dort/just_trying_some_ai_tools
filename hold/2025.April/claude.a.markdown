Logistic regression is one of the fundamental classification algorithms in machine learning, offering a straightforward approach to binary classification problems. Here's how it works:

## Core Concept of Logistic Regression

Logistic regression models the probability that an input belongs to a particular class using the logistic function (also called the sigmoid function).

## How It Works: Step by Step

1. **Linear Combination**
   - First, form a linear combination of input features: z = w₀ + w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ
   - Where w are the model weights and x are the feature values

2. **Apply the Sigmoid Function**
   - Transform this linear combination using the sigmoid function: P(y=1|x) = 1/(1+e^(-z))
   - This maps any input to a probability between 0 and 1

3. **Decision Boundary**
   - Classify as positive if P(y=1|x) > 0.5 (equivalent to z > 0)
   - Classify as negative if P(y=1|x) < 0.5 (equivalent to z < 0)
   - The decision boundary is where z = 0 (a hyperplane in feature space)

4. **Parameter Estimation**
   - Find the optimal weights by maximizing the likelihood function
   - This is typically done using gradient descent or variants like Newton's method
   - Goal: Find weights that make the predicted probabilities as close as possible to actual outcomes

## Mathematical Details

The logistic regression model can be written as:

P(y=1|x) = σ(w·x) = 1/(1+e^(-w·x))

Where:
- σ is the sigmoid function
- w is the weight vector 
- x is the feature vector

The cost function used to train logistic regression is the negative log-likelihood:

J(w) = -∑[yᵢlog(P(y=1|xᵢ)) + (1-yᵢ)log(1-P(y=1|xᵢ))]

This cost function:
- Penalizes confident but wrong predictions heavily
- Results in convex optimization (no local minima)
- Can be minimized efficiently

## Key Properties

- Creates a linear decision boundary in feature space
- Outputs well-calibrated probabilities (not just classifications)
- Relatively robust to noise
- Less prone to overfitting than more complex models
- Computationally efficient
- Highly interpretable (weights directly indicate feature importance)

## Extensions

- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: Extends to multiple classes
- **Regularization**: L1 or L2 penalties can be added to prevent overfitting
- **Kernel Logistic Regression**: Can create non-linear decision boundaries using kernels

Despite its name containing "regression," logistic regression is fundamentally a classification algorithm that elegantly outputs probabilities rather than just class labels.
